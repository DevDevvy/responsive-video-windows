<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Randall's Windows: Face 1 is the first installmment of my ongoing open-source, free-to-use front-end templates and apps with the aim to give back some value to the open source and tech community that has been so kind to me.


Here's why:
* I am constantly inspired by the developers and people who give their time and knowledge to me freely
* I feel a need to give back, to pay it forward somehow
* I love to build and hope my templates inspire other people to start building. If you create something with one of them, please tag me and let me see your creations! :smile:

### Built With

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* Good old fashioned vanilla JavaScript and CSS
